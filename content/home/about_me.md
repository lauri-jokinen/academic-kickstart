## Education
I've finished my Bachelor's and Master's theses at the Aalto University, in collaboration with KONE Corporation. Both theses handle optimal packing of elevators with various objects.

My math skills are notable. I'm fast a learner when it comes to mathematical concepts and complex systems. My specialities are optimization, numerical methods, data analysis and linear algebra.

I'm familiar with the most popular high level coding languages, with a slight exception of web software development. I have taken an elementary course on C language as well.

## Associations

I've worked as a treasurer for the Polytech Choir, for three years time (yearly sales approx. 130 kâ‚¬). Also, I have conducted a closing of a small company owned by the choir. Back in the day, I was a scout leader for three years.

# My own projects


Currently, I'm interested in smart tech that controls existing home heating systems. With these solutions, we can slow down the climate change with small investments.
With this idea in mind, I've coded a Python Telegram bot for myself which enables home heating control and automation. The system works with various Bluetooth and WiFi devices.

Also, I have coded an "invoice sender" with Google Apps Script, which works with Procountor accounting software. The tool reduces the treasurer's work by automating the invoice sending, and also saves a little money.

Lastly, I will mention a graphics tool for making a carefully compositioned matrix of photos. The tool includes Adobe ExtendScript (JavaScript) macros for Adobe Illustrator, and speeds up the workflow for this kind of printed material.

# Character

I value thorough thinking and attention to detail. As a former scout, and millennial, I want to leave this world a little better than I found it. I'm a thoughtful, calm, persistent and innovative. My friends say that I never get mad. I'm able to work in a team or independently. I'm a co-operative and active worker.

# Hobbies

I sing in the Polytech Choir and in a party band called Fii Fighters. I also play guitar and performed in Fyysikkospeksi 2017 as an actor. I have designed a few

as well. In the Defence Forces, I worked in the Conscript Band's media team.

Small coding and math projects are part of everyday life even here at home. If a thought aches my mind, I often code it out or try to solve it with pen and paper.
